# Project:

P&IDs (Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams) are detailed schematic representations used extensively in industrial and manufacturing applications. They provide a comprehensive visual overview of the physical interconnections and control schemes in a process system. P&IDs typically include Piping, Process equipment (e.g. vessels, pumps, heat exchangers), Control devices and instrumentation, Valves and fittings and Safety systems SymphonyAI offers a range of AI-powered solutions for the industrial and manufacturing sector, focusing on improving operational efficiency, asset performance, and decision-making. Symphony AI leverages P&IDs to build a structured knowledge graph representation of the complete installation across a new customer. The manual process of digitizing these types of diagrams is a major roadblock in the process of onboarding new customers and factories. This process often requires manual effort especially when onboarding new customers given the wide spectrum of P&ID schemas across the world. In this project, our aim is to develop \*CV and NLP) algorithms to fully automate the process of ingesting and extracting structured information from P&IDs specs and diagrams and translate them into a knowledge graph comprising of nodes (e.g. pumps) and edges (eg pipes). The approach will leverage both visual and textual information from images and pdf documents to first parse out the P&ID specifications from PDF documents and then use that information to detect components within the P&ID images using computer vision, nlp and OCR.

# Data:

For this project, team will be expected to leverage both public as well as symphony ai specific datasets to develop their solutions as well as prove out the efficacy and generalizability of their solutions.

Here are the publicly available synthetic datasets that will be considered for initial development.

Team will be encouraged to do their literature review to identify or build additional datasets as needed. The team will also have the opportunity to work with mentors to have their solutions run against the Symphony AI data to test the generalizability of their solutions.

# Progress, Goals and Timeline:

Week 0:

Milestone 1: Do a presentation next Friday on these topics

- Literature Review: approaches/papers/ methodologies. Come up with recommendation on potential approaches to tackle this problem.
- Data Analysis: Also highlight existing approaches and results.
- Tools and Libraries:
- Understand the key challenges
- Things that should be clearly understood: relevant offline metrics, data sources, start with a current model that is known to work.

Stretch Goal:
â€¢ Create a baseline on the dataset
